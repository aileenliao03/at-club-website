Our mission is to make the world more accessible to everyone by building connections within our community and fostering collaborative efforts to create inclusive technology. Through AT@MIT, we introduce students to the fun (and challenging) design space of assistive technology while building connections between community members, engineers, and designers. We hope to inspire participants to pursue projects in the AT space in the future.
